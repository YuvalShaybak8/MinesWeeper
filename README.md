# MinesWeeper

A simple implementation of the classic Minesweeper in your terminal.

Motivation
Just wanted a simple project to practice C.

- Initially the game shows the user a menu  
- the user chooses which board he wants to play or selects the number 0 to exit the game.
- Then when he chooses the one of the options(8X8,12X12,15X15 or custom size)
- The user see the board he asked for and the machine asks him to insert two variables representing a cell in the board to start opening them.
- There are two options of entering numbers
 1. When he wants to open a cell he inserts the cell and then the letter O or o. To open the cell. 
 2. If he suspects that a particular cell is a mine, he inserts the cell and then the letter F or f.
- In the game the user should try to open all the cells in the board without accidentally opening a mine.
- If he manages to uncover the entire board without exposing a cell with a mine he will win the game.
- There is an option of cheat, that when you enter two numbers, the first of which is - 1
- the machine will expose all the cells according to the second number that the user entered, without revealing mines.
